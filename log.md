# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I have started the 100 Days of Code challenge to keep myself accountable while I commit to learning React and Node. These two JavaScript frameworks will be used during my  Digital Jobs Program paid work placement with Services Victoria as a Web Development intern. I am also working on launching a blog to chronicle my research into digital literacy and digital competence.

Reading the most recent article by Alex Kallaway [Take the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Itâ€™s the fastest way to form a coding habit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/take-the-100daysofcode-challenge-make-coding-a-habit-4a655d8663fd/) and listening to him speak about #100DaysOfCode on the [Stack Overflow Podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/), the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/100-days-of-code), and the [Learn to Code With Me podcast](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/100-days-of-code-with-alexander-kallaway/) helped to build the courage to get started.

### Day 1: 27th of July 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created a new Space on W3schools to share the Digital Competence resources that I have been collecting for a blog I have wanted to create since the beginning of this year. Starting with HTML and CSS for now, but plan to add some interactive features using vanilla JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I am a bit nervous about publicly commiting to this challenge for 100 days, but it will help to hold back my natural inclination towards procrastination.

### Day 2: 28th of July 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created a div class for content from an Australian context with embedded videos. Also added APA 7th Style references.

**Thoughts:** Not everything worked as well as I hoped, but I will try again tomorrow to add the styling through CSS that I intended for the sections
 Also hoping to use both Flexbox and CSS Gridore effectively to make a mobile first responsive design for this blog.
