# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I have started the 100 Days of Code challenge to keep myself accountable while I commit to learning React and Node. These two JavaScript frameworks will be used during my  Digital Jobs Program paid work placement with Services Victoria as a Web Development intern. I am also working on launching a blog to chronicle my research into digital literacy and digital competence.

Reading the most recent article by Alex Kallaway [Take the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Itâ€™s the fastest way to form a coding habit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/take-the-100daysofcode-challenge-make-coding-a-habit-4a655d8663fd/) and listening to him speak about #100DaysOfCode on the [Stack Overflow Podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/), the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/100-days-of-code), and the [Learn to Code With Me podcast](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/100-days-of-code-with-alexander-kallaway/) helped to build the courage to get started.

### Day 1: 27th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a new Space on W3schools to share the Digital Competence resources that I have been collecting for a blog I have wanted to create since the beginning of this year. Starting with HTML and CSS for now, but plan to add some interactive features using vanilla JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I am a bit nervous about publicly commiting to this challenge for 100 days, but it will help to hold back my natural inclination towards procrastination.

### Day 2: 28th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a div class for content from an Australian context with embedded videos. Also added APA 7th Style references.

**Thoughts:** Not everything worked as well as I hoped, but I will try again tomorrow to add the styling through CSS that I intended for the sections.
 Also hoping to use both Flexbox and CSS Grid more effectively to make a mobile first responsive design for this blog.

### Day 3: 29th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added more text to the blog and links to external pages. Tweaked the CSS to get the embedded YouTube videos to have a better aspect ratio.

**Thoughts:** It was a good feeling to see my edits to the code result in the change I wanted. 
The in-built code editor in W3 Spaces has quite good functionality in both mobile and desktop format with a live preview of the website.

### Day 4: 30th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Posted my progress through the @Sololearn HTML and CSS tutorials as a code snippet. It is a useful way to keep track of my progress, as well as reinforce the theory through practise.

**Thoughts:** Trying out different online tutorials has been useful for reinforcing what I learned in General Assembly's Front-End Web Development Course. It is nice to feel like part of the community at Sololearn and the comments section in particular has proven to be very helpful in extending my knowledge.

### Day 5: 31st of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Read more of the React tutorial in readiness for beginning to use this JavaScript framework during my internship that starts in a couple of days. Created a free AWS account to get familiar with the cloud server that I will be using there. I also need to take a look at the Node documentation.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the concepts in these frameworks, so I have not been confident enough to publicly code using React or Node. However, I am confident that they will make more sense once I have a practical way to apply the theory with the project that I will be working on in my internship.
