# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I have started the 100 Days of Code challenge to keep myself accountable while I commit to learning React and Node. These two JavaScript frameworks will be used during my  Digital Jobs Program paid work placement with Services Victoria as a Web Development intern. I am also working on launching a blog to chronicle my research into digital literacy and digital competence.

Reading the most recent article by Alex Kallaway [Take the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Itâ€™s the fastest way to form a coding habit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/take-the-100daysofcode-challenge-make-coding-a-habit-4a655d8663fd/) and listening to him speak about #100DaysOfCode on the [Stack Overflow Podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/), the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/100-days-of-code), and the [Learn to Code With Me podcast](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/100-days-of-code-with-alexander-kallaway/) helped to build the courage to get started.

### Day 1: 27th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a new Space on W3schools to share the Digital Competence resources that I have been collecting for a blog I have wanted to create since the beginning of this year. Starting with HTML and CSS for now, but plan to add some interactive features using vanilla JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I am a bit nervous about publicly commiting to this challenge for 100 days, but it will help to hold back my natural inclination towards procrastination.

### Day 2: 28th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a div class for content from an Australian context with embedded videos. Also added APA 7th Style references.

**Thoughts:** Not everything worked as well as I hoped, but I will try again tomorrow to add the styling through CSS that I intended for the sections.
 Also hoping to use both Flexbox and CSS Grid more effectively to make a mobile first responsive design for this blog.

### Day 3: 29th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added more text to the blog and links to external pages. Tweaked the CSS to get the embedded YouTube videos to have a better aspect ratio.

**Thoughts:** It was a good feeling to see my edits to the code result in the change I wanted. 
The in-built code editor in W3 Spaces has quite good functionality in both mobile and desktop format with a live preview of the website.

### Day 4: 30th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Posted my progress through the @Sololearn HTML and CSS tutorials as a code snippet. It is a useful way to keep track of my progress, as well as reinforce the theory through practise.

**Thoughts:** Trying out different online tutorials has been useful for reinforcing what I learned in General Assembly's Front-End Web Development Course. It is nice to feel like part of the community at Sololearn and the comments section in particular has proven to be very helpful in extending my knowledge.

### Day 5: 31st of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Read more of the React tutorial in readiness for beginning to use this JavaScript framework during my internship that starts in a couple of days. Created a free AWS account to get familiar with the cloud server that I will be using there. I also need to take a look at the Node documentation.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the concepts in these frameworks, so I have not been confident enough to publicly code using React or Node. However, I am confident that they will make more sense once I have a practical way to apply the theory with the project that I will be working on in my internship.

### Day 6: 1st of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I didn't get a chance to code today, but I did get back into listening to The CSS Podcast again, which has such a vibrant energy to it and has connected me with some really useful resources for exploring the cascade, specificity, Flexbox and Grid. This is one podcast that I intend to listen to in its entirety.

**Thoughts:** I'm okay with taking it slow with this challenge as I will not always have an hour to spare for coding each day, but this is a good opportunity to build new habits.

### Day 7: 2nd of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took a couple of steps forward in the *Tutorial: Intro to React* on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**Thoughts:** I don't mind taking my time with this tutorial, and it actually recommends that you do so (instead of rushing through). I prefer taking time for concepts to absorb, as rote learning has never had a lasting effect on my memory or indeed how I undertake any new task.

### Day 8: 3rd of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed two more steps of the *Tutorial: Intro to React* on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**Thoughts:** I need to debug as it is not working the same as the incremental examples on the tutorial. However, the concepts make sense so far.

### Day 9: 4th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today was my last day at my non-coding part-time job. Unsurprisingly, I did not get much coding done. However, I did chip away a little further at the CSS tutorial on Sololearn (91% complete!).

**Thoughts:** It is a relief to not be dividing my attention away from my intended career path.

### Day 10: 5th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Second day as a Software Engineering Intern at Service Victoria and the first day working from home. I'm quite enjoying using the Microsoft Surface Pro 7+ provided to me by work, however I think I will get a separate keyboard and display to make my set up a bit more ergonomic. I completed the *Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting* tutorial in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to finally officially be able to concentrate fully on my paid work placement for the Digital Jobs Program. Code switching between a non-tech job and where my heart truly belongs as a Front End Web Developer / Software Engineer has been quite draining. I quite enjoyed applying `margin`, `padding`, `filter`, `border-radius`, and `transform` properties to create an approximation of abstract art in part 6 of the *(New) Responsive Web Design* in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 11: 6th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I had a go at this week's #CodePenChallenge. Making a "Looooong Teeeeext" generator was good fun. I also experimented with using an iframe for the first time, so that the newsletter from which the Challenge found the prompt.

**Thoughts:** CodePen has been a magnificent source of inspiration for me, especially as someone new to coding. Seeing the work of those that I admire has helped to feel like it is possible for me to be creative with how I respond to coding challenges. This is the first time I have

### Day 12: 7th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Tried out the browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) [JSFiddle](https://docs.jsfiddle.net/getting-started) as a sandbox to experiment with [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/get-started) icons to create a **Social Links** page for myself.

**Thoughts:** JSFiddle was very user-friendly and has a an interface that you can jump straight in and use. I particularly appreciate the options for Editor Layout. The range of free icons on offer from Font Awesome is very impressive and again very user-friendly.

### Day 13: 8th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** No coding today, as I was on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Manchester, with a two-hour stopover in Dubai. Hence, access to internet to unreliable at best.

**Thoughts:** I will add a couple of days at the end of the challenge to make up for the days lost in transit during this trip.

### Day 14: 9th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I practised some of the concepts covered in the CSS course on Sololearn. Specifically, CSS properties that I have not used previously including: `linear-gradient`, `text-shadow`, `letter-spacing`, and `drop-shadow`.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite happy with how everything turned out and confident that I can use these techniques in future projects.

### Day 15: 10th of August 2022 & Day 16: 11th of August

**Progress:** Completed *Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery* project on freeCodeCamp. It helped to demonstrate the utility of the following CSS properties: `box-sizing`, `max-width`, `flex-wrap`, `object-fit`, and `gap`.
 I also have not used the `::after` pseudo elements before, so it was handy to see that in action.

**Thoughts:** I am happy to have consolidated the practical use of Flexbox a little more and even applied properties and a pseudo element that I have not used in my own projects yet.

### Day 17: 12th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked out what I needed to fix to progress in the *Tutorial: Intro to React* - I was missing one curly bracket at the end of the arrow function within the button. Hence, I was able to keep going with the tutorial project of creating a Tic Tac Toe game using React.

**Thoughts:** It was a relief to figure out that bug, so that I can continue to chip away at this introduction to React.

### Day 18: 13th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Recreated the Moon Phases puzzle from [Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.app/faq/) in JS Fiddle. It makes use of the [D3 library](https://d3js.org/) to create SVG animations.

**Thoughts:** It was a good confidence boost to show myself that I can emulate what I have learned about JavaScript from the puzzles in Grasshopper.

### Day 19: 14th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I tried the second CodePen Challenge for August: *All Unique Characters*. I was inspired by the solution created by @nicoleontech for the original prompt in the newsletter by @cassidoo: [nicoleontech/cassidoo-interviewQuestions/unique.js](https://github.com/nicoleontech/cassidoo-interviewQuestions/blob/37d05aa80de748b1705ac1c4fc6b791e8abe250c/unique.js).

**Thoughts:**  This was a useful example of the application of: `for` loops, comparison operators, `indexOf()`, and `lastIndexOf`.

### Day 20: 15th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed the *Lifting State Up* step of the [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**Thoughts:** React is still confusing to me, but the `.slice()`, `onClick` and `handleClick` code from this step were familiar from my JavaScript knowledge.
