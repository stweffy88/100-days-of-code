# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I have started the 100 Days of Code challenge to keep myself accountable while I commit to learning React and Node. These two JavaScript frameworks will be used during my  Digital Jobs Program paid work placement with Services Victoria as a Web Development intern. I am also working on launching a blog to chronicle my research into digital literacy and digital competence.

Reading the most recent article by Alex Kallaway [Take the #100DaysOfCode Challenge. Itâ€™s the fastest way to form a coding habit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/take-the-100daysofcode-challenge-make-coding-a-habit-4a655d8663fd/) and listening to him speak about #100DaysOfCode on the [Stack Overflow Podcast](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/), the [CodeNewbie Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/100-days-of-code), and the [Learn to Code With Me podcast](https://learntocodewith.me/podcast/100-days-of-code-with-alexander-kallaway/) helped to build the courage to get started.

### Day 1: 27th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a new Space on W3schools to share the Digital Competence resources that I have been collecting for a blog I have wanted to create since the beginning of this year. Starting with HTML and CSS for now, but plan to add some interactive features using vanilla JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I am a bit nervous about publicly commiting to this challenge for 100 days, but it will help to hold back my natural inclination towards procrastination.

### Day 2: 28th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Created a div class for content from an Australian context with embedded videos. Also added APA 7th Style references.

**Thoughts:** Not everything worked as well as I hoped, but I will try again tomorrow to add the styling through CSS that I intended for the sections.
 Also hoping to use both Flexbox and CSS Grid more effectively to make a mobile first responsive design for this blog.

### Day 3: 29th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added more text to the blog and links to external pages. Tweaked the CSS to get the embedded YouTube videos to have a better aspect ratio.

**Thoughts:** It was a good feeling to see my edits to the code result in the change I wanted. 
The in-built code editor in W3 Spaces has quite good functionality in both mobile and desktop format with a live preview of the website.

### Day 4: 30th of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Posted my progress through the @Sololearn HTML and CSS tutorials as a code snippet. It is a useful way to keep track of my progress, as well as reinforce the theory through practise.

**Thoughts:** Trying out different online tutorials has been useful for reinforcing what I learned in General Assembly's Front-End Web Development Course. It is nice to feel like part of the community at Sololearn and the comments section in particular has proven to be very helpful in extending my knowledge.

### Day 5: 31st of July 2022

**Today's Progress:** Read more of the React tutorial in readiness for beginning to use this JavaScript framework during my internship that starts in a couple of days. Created a free AWS account to get familiar with the cloud server that I will be using there. I also need to take a look at the Node documentation.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the concepts in these frameworks, so I have not been confident enough to publicly code using React or Node. However, I am confident that they will make more sense once I have a practical way to apply the theory with the project that I will be working on in my internship.

### Day 6: 1st of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I didn't get a chance to code today, but I did get back into listening to The CSS Podcast again, which has such a vibrant energy to it and has connected me with some really useful resources for exploring the cascade, specificity, Flexbox and Grid. This is one podcast that I intend to listen to in its entirety.

**Thoughts:** I'm okay with taking it slow with this challenge as I will not always have an hour to spare for coding each day, but this is a good opportunity to build new habits.

### Day 7: 2nd of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Took a couple of steps forward in the *Tutorial: Intro to React* on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**Thoughts:** I don't mind taking my time with this tutorial, and it actually recommends that you do so (instead of rushing through). I prefer taking time for concepts to absorb, as rote learning has never had a lasting effect on my memory or indeed how I undertake any new task.

**Link to work:** [React Tutorial fork - Tic Tac Toe on CodePen](https://codepen.io/stweffy_88/pen/RwMxbRz)

### Day 8: 3rd of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed two more steps of the *Tutorial: Intro to React* on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**Thoughts:** I need to debug as it is not working the same as the incremental examples on the tutorial. However, the concepts make sense so far.

### Day 9: 4th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today was my last day at my non-coding part-time job. Unsurprisingly, I did not get much coding done. However, I did chip away a little further at the CSS tutorial on Sololearn (91% complete!).

**Thoughts:** It is a relief to not be dividing my attention away from my intended career path.

**Link to work:** [Sololearn profile](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/25656677/?ref=app)

### Day 10: 5th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Second day as a Software Engineering Intern at Service Victoria and the first day working from home. I'm quite enjoying using the Microsoft Surface Pro 7+ provided to me by work, however I think I will get a separate keyboard and display to make my set up a bit more ergonomic. I completed the *Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting* tutorial in freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to finally officially be able to concentrate fully on my paid work placement for the Digital Jobs Program. Code switching between a non-tech job and where my heart truly belongs as a Front End Web Developer / Software Engineer has been quite draining. I quite enjoyed applying `margin`, `padding`, `filter`, `border-radius`, and `transform` properties to create an approximation of abstract art in part 6 of the *(New) Responsive Web Design* in freeCodeCamp.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stweffy_88)

### Day 11: 6th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I had a go at this week's #CodePenChallenge. Making a "Looooong Teeeeext" generator was good fun. I also experimented with using an iframe for the first time, so that the newsletter from which the Challenge found the prompt.

**Thoughts:** CodePen has been a magnificent source of inspiration for me, especially as someone new to coding. Seeing the work of those that I admire has helped to feel like it is possible for me to be creative with how I respond to coding challenges. This is the first time I have

### Day 12: 7th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Tried out the browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) [JSFiddle](https://docs.jsfiddle.net/getting-started) as a sandbox to experiment with [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/get-started) icons to create a **Social Links** page for myself.

**Thoughts:** JSFiddle was very user-friendly and has a an interface that you can jump straight in and use. I particularly appreciate the options for Editor Layout. The range of free icons on offer from Font Awesome is very impressive and again very user-friendly.

**Link to work:** https://jsfiddle.net/stweffy_88/yq4vt9L2/52/

### Day 13: 8th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** No coding today, as I was on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Manchester, with a two-hour stopover in Dubai. Hence, access to internet to unreliable at best.

**Thoughts:** I will add a couple of days at the end of the challenge to make up for the days lost in transit during this trip.

### Day 14: 9th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I practised some of the concepts covered in the CSS course on Sololearn. Specifically, CSS properties that I have not used previously including: `linear-gradient`, `text-shadow`, `letter-spacing`, and `drop-shadow`.

**Thoughts:** I'm quite happy with how everything turned out and confident that I can use these techniques in future projects.

**Link to work:** https://jsfiddle.net/stweffy_88/sxtvn2w8/43/

### Day 15: 10th of August 2022 & Day 16: 11th of August

**Progress:** Completed *Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery* project on freeCodeCamp. It helped to demonstrate the utility of the following CSS properties: `box-sizing`, `max-width`, `flex-wrap`, `object-fit`, and `gap`.
 I also have not used the `::after` pseudo elements before, so it was handy to see that in action.

**Thoughts:** I am happy to have consolidated the practical use of Flexbox a little more and even applied properties and a pseudo element that I have not used in my own projects yet.

### Day 17: 12th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked out what I needed to fix to progress in the *Tutorial: Intro to React* - I was missing one curly bracket at the end of the arrow function within the button. Hence, I was able to keep going with the tutorial project of creating a Tic Tac Toe game using React.

**Thoughts:** It was a relief to figure out that bug, so that I can continue to chip away at this introduction to React.

### Day 18: 13th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Recreated the Moon Phases puzzle from [Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.app/faq/) in JS Fiddle. It makes use of the [D3 library](https://d3js.org/) to create SVG animations.

**Thoughts:** It was a good confidence boost to show myself that I can emulate what I have learned about JavaScript from the puzzles in Grasshopper.

**Link to work:** https://jsfiddle.net/stweffy_88/79fejd60/124/

### Day 19: 14th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** I tried the second CodePen Challenge for August: *All Unique Characters*. I was inspired by the solution created by @nicoleontech for the original prompt in the newsletter by @cassidoo: [nicoleontech/cassidoo-interviewQuestions/unique.js](https://github.com/nicoleontech/cassidoo-interviewQuestions/blob/37d05aa80de748b1705ac1c4fc6b791e8abe250c/unique.js).

**Thoughts:**  This was a useful example of the application of: `for` loops, comparison operators, `indexOf()`, and `lastIndexOf`.

### Day 20: 15th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed the *Lifting State Up* step of the [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**Thoughts:** React is still confusing to me, but the `.slice()`, `onClick` and `handleClick` code from this step were familiar from my JavaScript knowledge.

**Link to work:** [React Tutorial fork - Tic Tac Toe on CodePen](https://codepen.io/stweffy_88/pen/RwMxbRz)

### Day 21: 16th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed 63% of the *Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label* project (Step 1 to Step 42) on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** This is good for refreshing CSS layout concepts and it was the first time I have used the `clear` and `overflow` properties.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp profile showing progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stweffy_88)

### Day 22: 17th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the *Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label* project (Step 43 to Step 66) on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was useful to see how multiple styles can be added to HTML elements using the `class` attribute. This was my first use of the `:not` pseudo-selector to exclude elements that do not match the given CSS rule. Also, I have not used the `text-indent` property before.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp profile showing progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stweffy_88)

### Day 23: 18th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Emulated another [Grasshopper app](https://grasshopper.app/about/) puzzle with a few tweaks. One of these was positioning the red square 50 pixels further away from the top of the screen, to make the four coloured squares look more like a game controller. I also did not include the code from the puzzle explainer pertaining to a `color` variable and the Grasshopper custom `pickRandom()` function, so I could just focus on the following d3 concepts: `.attr('cx',)`, `.attr('cy',)`, `.on('click',)`, and `.transition()`.

**Thoughts:** It was fun to recreate this puzzle in JS Fiddle. The animation possibilities with the [d3 JavaScript library](https://d3js.org/) are quite interesting to me and I'm glad to have had the chance to explore them through the Grasshopper app.

### Day 24: 19th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** No coding today, as I was attending a wedding.

**Thoughts:** I will add another day at the end of the challenge to make up for the missed day.

### Day 25: 20th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** No coding today, as I had no consistent internet to use while in transit.

**Thoughts:** I will add another day at the end of the challenge to make up for the missed day.

### Day 26: 21st of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started the *Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz* project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I will take my time with this project and not rush the steps, as Accessibilty is a subject that means a lot to me.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp profile showing progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stweffy_88)

### Day 27: 22nd of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** No coding, as I was flying from Manchester back to Melbourne, via Dubai. So there was no consistent internet.

**Thoughts:** I will have to add five days to the end of this challenge to make up for those that I have missed.

### Day 28: 23rd of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Researched Cron jobs for a project assigned to myself and the other Software Engineering interns. I will need to learn more about Command Line Interface before I use it, but the theory makes sense for this scheduling automation tool. Continued the *Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz* project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The flow of data between the web scraper, Cron job and JSON schema will be easier to conceptualize with the three interns working on researching each component individually. In the freeCodeCamp project, I have been introduced to the `aspect-ratio` property.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp profile showing progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stweffy_88)

### Day 29: 24th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Progressed to almost halfway through the Sololearn *Responsive Web Design* course.

**Thoughts:** Picking up useful tips from this course for my blog that I am designing. I intend to make a mobile first responsive website.

**Link to work:** https://code.sololearn.com/WnPCf8D4Jyph/?ref=app

### Day 30: 25th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Ironically, did not get any coding done despite a busy day at my Software Engineering internship. It was filled with largely research on System Architecture Diagrams and Cron documentation.

**Thoughts:** Despite no coding, I am loving my new job. This internship is combining my educational design knowledge and love of facilitating the growth of knowledge in myself and others.

### Day 31: 26th of August & Day 32: 27th of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Step 10 to Step 16 of *Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz* project on freeCodeCamp. I had not come across the `role` or `aria-labelledby` attribute previously, so I look forward to doing further research into this part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). https://www.w3.org/TR/role-attribute/

**Thoughts:** Steadily making my way through the concepts on this project. There may be the temptation to rush tutorials like this, but then the concepts they teach are less likely to be retained.

### Day 33: 28th of August 2022 & Day 34: 29th of August

**Today's Progress:** Reinforced what I have covered so far in the *Responsive Web Design* course on Sololearn by recreating it in JSfiddle.

**Thoughts:** I needed to adjust the HTML and CSS to make it work in a text editor outside of the Sololearn environment, but I was successful.

### Day 35: 30th of August 2022 & Day 36: 31st of August 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Step 17 to Step 25 of *Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz* project on freeCodeCamp. I have not used text that only screen readers can see before, so I will remember to use the CSS rules for the `sr-only` class that were made for this project. These included `overflow: hidden;`, `clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);`, and `white-space: nowrap;`.

**Thoughts:** This part of the project was an important reminder of how the relationship between the `label` tag and the ID of the `input` tag  provides a visual reference to the input for those who use assistive technology.

### Day 37: 1st of September 2022 & Day 38: 2nd of September 2022

**Today's Progress:** Gained knowledge about Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) to enable access to the GitHub Enterprise Server for my internship.

**Thoughts:** This is unfamiliar territory for me, but the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) are very thorough and help to walk through each step of the process.

### Day 39: 3rd of September 2022

**Today's Progress:** Forked my previous JS Fiddle to continue practising what I am learning in the *Responsive Web Design* course on Sololearn. I have progressed to the next section which focuses on *Making it Responsive*.

**Thoughts:** It was good to reinforce what I have already covered in the Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly regarding media queries, breakpoints, and the CSS properties `min-width` and `max-width`.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page - Making it Responsive](https://jsfiddle.net/stweffy_88/fu1yw0bt/21/)

### Day 40: 4th of September 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued reinforcing my learning from the *Responsive Web Design* course on Sololearn by coding along in my JS Fiddle.

**Thoughts:** It is always reaffirming to see a Flexbox layout just work. In particular, the change from horizontal alignment of the three features on a desktop screen to vertical alignment on a mobile screen.

**Link to work:** [Landing Page - Making it Responsive](https://jsfiddle.net/stweffy_88/fu1yw0bt/21/)

### Day 41: 5th of September 2022 & Day 42: 6th of September 2022

**Today's Progress:** As mentioned previously, I have been working on adding an SSH key to GitHub, but I was only successful after a few tries in between tasks at work. The code I was entering into from the guide into Microsoft PowerShell was not working as it should, so I ended up consulting Stack Overflow to find the answer.

**Thoughts:** I was pretty frustrated after what appeared to be a pretty straightforward task on both GitHub Docs and the YouTube tutorials that I found. However, I have not used Command Line before so the concepts are unfamiliar to me. In the end, I was able to figure out the relative path to the SSH key `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Since neither the terminal in Visual Code nor Microsoft PowerShell would accept the code snippet from GitHub Docs (`clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`), I instead used the `Get-Content` command instead of `clip` and it worked.

### Day 43: 7th of September 2022 & Day 44: 8th of September 2022

**Today's Progress:** Returned to the *Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz* project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Using `fieldset` and `legend` are important skills for grouping information in a HTML form together. The nested elements within the `fieldset` are related to one another and it draws a box around them. The `legend` tag provides a caption for the fieldset that is visible on the page. The `name` attribute of the `fieldset` tag gives the name of the grouping of related elements within.

**Link to work:** [freeCodeCamp profile showing progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stweffy_88)

### Day 45: 9th of September 2022

**Today's Progress:** Coded along to *15.1 LESSON: Responsive Quote & Footer* from the *Responsive Web Design* course on Sololearn.

**Thoughts:** With a mobile-first responsive design in mind, the following changes were made: 
- The padding is increased and the font size is decreased when viewed on a mobile screen.
- When viewed on a mobile screen, the list items in the footer become block level elements. This means that they extend across the whole width of their container, which makes them align beneath each other.

### Day 46: 10th of September 2022 & Day 47: 11th of September

**Today's Progress:** I need to be able to switch between versions of Node, so I was asked to try to install Node Version Manager (NVM) and then Node version 16.7.0 (Long Term Support (LTS) at this point in time). I am not able to use the method described for Mac or Linux in the repository (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) as I have been supplied with a Surface Pro 7+ for this internship. When I looked into Corey Butler's NVM for Windows (https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), I was unable to follow the method described by many articles and YouTube videos as I do not have the administrator privileges required to use the installer on the computer that I have been supplied. 

When I researched the other options a little further, I found a Microsoft article which suggested Jason Ginchereau's [Node Version Switcher](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) (NVS) because it  has the ability to [integrate with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-windows#alternative-version-managers), which is the preferred text editor for this workplace. 

Thankfully, NVS worked and I was able to install the LTS version of Node.js (version 16.7.0).

**Thoughts:** I had not used Command Line Interface prior to this internship, so it has been a bit of a steep learning curve. However, I can see the advantages of being able to use text commands to interface directly with the operating system of a computer.

After trying each of the [Windows installation methods suggested by NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#important-notes) for a couple of days, it was a relief to find that NVS worked straight away. The [Visual Studio Code Support](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/blob/master/doc/VSCODE.md) was definitely appealing too.
